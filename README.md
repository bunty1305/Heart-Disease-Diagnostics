# Heart-Disease-Diagnostics

### Project Overview
This project is an in-depth analysis of a heart disease dataset, aimed at uncovering crucial insights to enhance the understanding, diagnosis, and management of heart disease. The analysis utilizes various statistical and visualization techniques to explore the relationships between different factors and the presence of heart disease.

### Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:

- age: Age of the individual
- sex: Gender of the individual (0 = female, 1 = male)
- chest_pain: Type of chest pain experienced (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
- resting_bp: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- cholesterol: Serum cholesterol (in mg/dL)
- fasting_blood_sugar: Fasting blood sugar level (> 120 mg/dL, 0 = no, 1 = yes)
- resting_ecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)
- max_heartrate: Maximum heart rate achieved
- exercise_induced_angina: Exercise-induced angina (0 = no, 1 = yes)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
- num_vessels_colored: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- thalassemia: Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect)
- heart_disease: Presence of heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)

### Conclusion
The insights derived from this analysis provide valuable information for better understanding the factors contributing to heart disease. By identifying key risk factors and patterns, we can improve screening, prevention, and treatment strategies. This project underscores the importance of comprehensive data analysis in healthcare and aims to contribute to better heart disease management and outcomes.
